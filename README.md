# Epic Game


### Project Description
Weekend long group project at <Academia de CÃ³digo_>.
QuizProject is a command line server/client project made in java using tcp protocol where multiple clients can connect to a server and play in pairs.

### The Idea
Quiz inspired on Who Wants to Be a Billionaire with a little twist. At the begining, you'll be presented with 5 questions and respective answers. These will be the questions your adversary will have to answer. You have the opportunity to add tricky answers in order to full your opponent.
After both players finish filling the options, the questions swap and may the best man win!


### Development 
The tasks division came naturally. We would sometimes gather and establish topics on a "to do list" and then work on them, individually or in pairs.
We used the Prompt-View library for producing interactive command line prompts. 


### Technologies
Java 8, Prompt-View Library, IntelliJ IDEA, Git.
